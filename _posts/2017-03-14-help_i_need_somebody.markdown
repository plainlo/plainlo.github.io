I have never liked asking for help. 

I always feel like I'm bothering people and that they secretly think I'm an idiot for having to ask. 

It's something that has always made me deeply uncomfortable. 

Since I started this bootcamp, I have asked for help with tuition from friends + family. I have asked coworkers + other engineering friends to help me with homework. Or to help me figure out why my text editor was working yesterday, but seems to be completely broken today. I have asked for help with GitHub. I have asked for help with Terminal and Bash profiles. 

I have even asked complete strangers for help via the 'Ask A Question' button on the Learn site.

And you know what? People *like* helping. They like being able to answer your questions. They like being able to show you something new. 

And you know what else? Asking for help is kind of like everything else- it gets easier [and less scary] the more you do it.
