Today was a not a great day. It was not even a good day. Today was a Bad Day. 

Things were hard. I didn't understand The New Thing. I got frustrated. I felt stupid. I asked for help [a number of different times, all about The New Thing]- I still felt stupid. Eventually, we got the tests passing, and I still don't understand why/how. 

It was a Bad Day. 

So why am I commemorating it with a blog post? 

Because [for maybe the first time in my life] - even tho I didn't understand The New Thing and I wasn't having fun and I felt frustratedandstupidandgrumpyandandand - I knew that I wasn't going to Quit. 

I don't understand The New Thing right now. And I might not even understand it tomorrow. But I am going to understand it eventually. And when I do, I will probably be smack in the middle of not understanding A New Something. 

I want to look back and remember that it wasn't all mini victories and flying through lessons, or struggling for an hour but then figuring it out and haha, it was just a TYPO! That there were lots of limit testing, character building, Frustrating To 11, swear word generating, unresolved questions days where the best thing I could find to say about it was *'I'm not going to quit'. 
*

I have a sneaking suspicion that maybe the work you do on the Bad Days can be more important than the work you do on the easier ones.
