Life happens. 

Good things happen. And bad things happen. 

You get a promotion at work [YAY!] and this means longer hours and more responsibility and suddenly, you don't have time for homework. And when you *do* have time, you're exhausted and your brain just doesn't work like you need it to. 

You start to fall into a pattern and things calm down, and then you find out a dear friend is sick. This diagnosis happens to coincide with another anniversary of a goodbye that you're still reeling from, and suddenly, you are reliving the trauma all over again. 

You bury yourself in the familiar- books and Netflix and videogames and more work.

And suddenly- it's been a month. *[How has it been a month?! It can't have been a month.]* You check the calendar again, and yes, it's been a month. 

And then you are embarrassed. And you feel like you've forgotten everything. And isn't it easier to keep procrastinating? 

But one day, you sit yourself down, and you force yourself to give it twenty minutes. And twenty minutes goes by, and you start to remember why you're doing this. And another twenty goes by. And they're not the lessons that you're 'supposed' to be doing, but they're the lessons that you need right now to refresh, and to get back into the habit. 

So you cut yourself a little break and you show gratitude for the 40 minutes. And you know that tomorrow, it will be harder to make excuses. 

And so it begins again.
